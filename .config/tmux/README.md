# Tmux Config

This directory contains my tmux configuration, managed via GNU Stow.

## Purpose
- Custom keybindings, theme, and usability tweaks

## Dependencies
- tmux (>=3.1 recommended)
- [Optional] Powerline fonts for status bar

## Special Setup
- Run `stow -vt ~ tmux` from the repo root to symlink configs
- For local customizations, create `.tmux.conf.local` (gitignored)

## Platform Notes
- Some keybindings may differ on macOS/Windows; see comments in config
